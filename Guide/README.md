## Additional Tools and Info
### Using AWS-CLI and JQ

#### AWS-CLI

If not already installed, easiest way to get it is via NPM [AWS-CLI on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-cli).
The AWS-CLI is a tremendously capable tool with which to interface with all the AWS services, but is beyond the scope of this project.

Having set up your `~/.aws/credentials` file for Serverless.com, the AWS-CLI will use that same identity file.
Use the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to select the profile to use when calling the AWS managed services.

#### JQ

Used to query and reshape JSON data in the shell, [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) is used to parse the REST services and pull the info we need out of the responses.
In-depth examination of this tools is also beyond the scope of this workshop, but is useful for querying the JSON data we get back from AWS-CLI queries and our REST endpoints.

#### Query AWS for your API Gateway ID

This command combines the AWS-CLI tools and JQ to get the ID of the API we just deployed above.

```sh
export APIID=`aws apigateway get-rest-apis --region us-west-2 | jq --arg stage $STAGE '.items[] | select(.name | startswith($stage)) | .id' | sed 's/"//g'`
echo $APIID
```

#### Use CURL to query your Winner API

Now that we've got the Amazon assigned ID of our winner-api we can query it:

```sh
curl -o - "https://${APIID}.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/${STAGE}/scores?role=creator&limit=2" | more
curl -o - "https://${APIID}.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/${STAGE}/scores?role=photographer&limit=2" | more
curl -o - "https://${APIID}.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/${STAGE}/contributions" | more
```
